    <h3 class="question">
        What is the difference between div and span?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Div tag is abbreviation for Division tag which is block level in nature, which means it is bound to take full length of the width of the screen irrespective of it's content and hence always starts in a new line and is often used to wrap the section of the document. Whereas Span happens to be an inline element that takes only the width that it's content requires and if it happens to come next to another inline tag, it starts within the same line and hence are used to wrap smaller portions of text or images within the document.

        What is the difference between class and IDs?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Both the Class and ID are used to identify the elements within the html file, but the difference is that the ID is unique to every element and one element can have only a single id, whereas class can be used to identify multiple elements and even a single element can have multiple classes. But the ID has an highest priority over Class when both of the attributes have a conflicting value.

        What are self closing tags?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Self closing tags are the type of tags that doesn't have a separate closing tag as they get closed within the opening tags itself. These tags are also known as empty tags since the element only contains the tag and nothing else like the attributes.

    <h3 class="question">
        How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where? 
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        There are a total of 6 types of heading tags which are all by default bold in text weight, namely:
        <pre>
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        &lt;h1&gt; ---> Font-Size : 32px
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        &lt;h2&gt; ---> Font-Size : 24px
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        &lt;h3&gt; ---> Font-Size : 18px
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        &lt;h4&gt; ---> Font-Size : 16px
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        &lt;h5&gt; ---> Font-Size : 14px
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
        &lt;h6&gt; ---> Font-Size : 12px
        </pre>
        So the headings have a priority from top to bottom and depending on the section we are working with, the appropriate tag is selected.

        What is the difference between block and inline?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Block level elements by default is bound to take full length of the width of the screen irrespective of it's content and hence always starts in a new line and by default has an added margin.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            <b>
                Example:
            </b>
            <pre>
                &lt;div&gt; , &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;p&gt; , &lt;pre&gt; , &lt;header&gt; , &lt;footer&gt; , &lt;section&gt; , &lt;form&gt; , &lt;nav&gt; , &lt;hr&gt; , &lt;blockquote&gt; , &lt;li&gt; 
            </pre>
        </i>
        Whereas an inline element takes only the width that it's content requires and if it happens to come next to another inline tag, it starts within the same line and hence they don't have an added margin and even styling like padding and margin doesn't get applied on it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            <b>
                Example:
            </b>
            <pre>
                &lt;a&gt; , &lt;b&gt; , &lt;i&gt; , &lt;span&gt; , &lt;button&gt; , &lt;lable&gt; , &lt;sub&gt; , &lt;sup&gt; , &lt;select&gt; , &lt;object&gt; , &lt;img&gt; , &lt;em&gt; , &lt;strong&gt;
            </pre>
        </i>
        But the nature of an element being block or inline can be easily changed in CSS by changing their display type.

        What is the difference between em and strong?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        em and strong both are special tags that can used as an alternative to i and b tags respectively. While em tag appears in italic and is used to emphasize the text that makes it stand out in the crowd, the strong tag that appears in bold is often used to convey the importance and urgency of the text.
