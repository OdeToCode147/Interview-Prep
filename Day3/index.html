        What is the difference between flex row and column?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Flex row and Flex column both are flex direction properties that define how the children element of the flex parent should be alinged. The property is given in the parent element and the flex children inherit them and can be called only when the display is given to be flex.

        Flex row considers the horizontal axis as the main axis and the vertical axis as the cross axis wheras wheras flex column considers the horizontal axis as the cross axis and the vertical axis as the main axis.

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Inline , internal and external, all 3 of these are styling techniques. While the end result of all 4 tends to be same, the place where they are mentioned changes their type.

        <b>
            Inline stylesheet:
        </b>
        They are the ones that are given next to the tagname in the html element and always holds the highest priority over the other two.

        </i>
        <b>
            Internal stylesheet:

        <b>

        What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Absolute and relative positioning, both are the position related properties. While absolute positioning ensures that the element is relatively positioned to its first non-static ancestor or its parent element, relative position based on it's current position and acts upon the baseline value hence the moves in a reverse direction of top, bottom, left and right given to it.

        What is grid-template-columns used for?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Grid-template-columns is a CSS property and comes under the grid that is used to assign the number of columns that we require. By default we give a size of auto that ends up taking the length of entire webpage and aligns equal space to all the columns if nothing overflows, and if it does, it automatically adjusts. We can even give our own custom width other than auto.

        What is the z-index in CSS?
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        The z-index is a 3D property in CSS that specifies the stack order of an element. By default every element has an z-index value of 0, but depending on our requirement, we can change it either positive values to bring it on top or negative values to send it to back.
        <i>
            <pre>
    &lt;div class1 style="z-index: -1;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class2 style="z-index: 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        Padding and Margin both are CSS box model properties.
